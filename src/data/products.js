    desc: "Black steel is a term given to steel pipe with a black oxide scale on the surface. This black oxide scale is formed when the pipe is forged and is typically sealed with a protective oil to prevent corrosion. Because of this oxide scale and protective film, black steel pipe requires little maintenance and is used for a wide variety of applications, including in water, steam, air and gas services.",
